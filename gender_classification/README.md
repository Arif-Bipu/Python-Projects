##Overview

Followed tutorial challenge 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on Youtube. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset body of metrics labeled male or female. It then guesses the gender given a set of body metrics.

##What I have added

I have personally added 4 other classifiers besides the original tree. I have added support vector machine, KNeighbors, Gaussian Process, and MLP classifier. These are all implemented with their probabilities shown as well. 

##Dependencies 

-Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
-numpy (pip install numpy)
-scipy (pip install scipy)

##Usage

Run script in cmd or terminal via

python demo.py
