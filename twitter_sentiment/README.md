# Overview

Followed tutorial challenge Twitter Sentiment Analysis Challenge for Learn Python for Data Science #2 by @Sirajology on Youtube. It uses the twitter API, tweepy, and textblob to interpret the sentiment in tweets on a given subject, in this case, Biden. 

## What I have added

I have personally created a way for some tweets to aggregate in a csv document where the tweet itself and the sentiment value, whether positive or negative, is shown next to the tweet. 

## Dependencies 

- tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)

- textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)


## Usage

Run script in cmd or terminal via

```python demo.py```
